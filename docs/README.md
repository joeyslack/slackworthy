### Jack Langworthy
**Ninayo**
In the fall of 2014 I started creating NINAYO.com. I had just read Peter Thiel's book Zero to One, and was reflecting on his question, "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" For me that answer was simple: The internet is fundamental to fixing food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Having spent three years working in the chaos and devastation of the Tanzanian agricultural sector, I began building the trading platform I wished had existed when I worked there as a logistics manager and Peace Corps Volunteer.

For decades, farmers and markets have been unable to communicate supply and demand efficiently. Yet both sides of the value chain are incentivized to share this information for their own financial gain. NINAYO.com is a simple mobile friendly means for farmers and markets to advertise to one another, drop a GPS pin in a map, and connect. Improving the ease of commerce through better business information may not sound like a sexy part of the fight against poverty, but it's essential.

**Ikea**
*Business Information Analyst*
*IKEA of Sweden*

On a near weekly basis I provide business performance updates to the board, CEO or other key management on the topics of growth, profitability, sustainability and quality. I work with an immensely talented and insightful team to compile these insights, fine tune the metrics and present the information clearly in both written and visual forms.

*Strategy Consultant*
*Carlsberg Group*
As part of my Copenhagen Business School MBA, I was selected by the R&D Department of Carlsberg A/S to work on a strategy project as a member of a six person team. The report we developed for the company is confidential, but it was enthusiastically praised by those overseeing the report in Carlsberg A/S. I feel obliged to make clear that I was never employed by Calrsberg A/S, but that I was working full time to develop a project at their request. I am more than happy to provide sterling references as to the quality of our report from numerous managers within Carlsberg's R&D department.

*Cheetah Development*
*Logistics Manager*
I oversaw the logistics department which was responsible for establishing the delivery of agricultural inputs and crop harvests throughout the Iringa region. I was also personally responsible for the warehousing of these inputs and harvests, including the implementation of a receipt system, quality assurance checks and security. We established smaller storage facilities in key villages along our supply routes, which coordinated and converged with the main central warehouse in Iringa town.

As logistics manager I was responsible for supply planning, demand forecasting, stock control, date and price of sale and inventory management. This required building my team and delegating tasks appropriately. There are many challenges that arise doing business in a harsh business climate like Tanzania (unreliable roads and rampant corruption), but I am proud of my performance as logistics manager, and can provide references from my stakeholders and CEO. 

Cheetah Development is a mid size company with a fluctuating number of employees depending on the season (5-25). I was highly involved with hiring new dozens of new interns and employees in the logistics and sales departments.

I established partnerships with NGO's working in the region, including acquiring a full time Peace Corps Volunteer to build capacity in our rural teams. 

I also served as the CEO's liaison during his regular work related absences and had the opportunity to learn and develop strategy with him.

Cheetah Development uses a truly incredible and practical approach to fighting poverty in underdeveloped regions. Through micro venture capital investments, Cheetah Development works to alleviate poverty by establishing relevant and sustainable businesses.

*Cheetah Development*
*Financial Compliance Officer*
In conjunction with my role as Logistics Manager, I established and implemented company-wide procurement and accounting procedures compliant with USAID/ CDC regulations. Cheetah Development paid for my Center for Development Excellence (CDE) courses and certifications in Financial Regulation and Rules and Regulations of USAID/ CDC Awards.

*Peace Corps*
*Business Developer and Educator*
I started a small-scale grain banking program in rural Ruvuma which increased what the growers earned for their crops by 100%. It brought investors a 50% return (from a 56% share of the profit) and paid the managing villager handsomely with a 44% share of the profit. I oversaw the merger of the company with Wilima Secondary School, where it continues to deliver revenue and ensure food supplies at the school.

I also worked at Wilima Secondary School in administrative and pedagogical functions. I taught mathematics, physics and computer science for 24 periods per week. I really enjoyed teaching and it helped to integrate me in the local community. I also successfully applied for, opened and closed a SPA Grant for the school which helped to build the schools computer lab. I oversaw the implementation of this computer lab, which also continues to this day.

### Joseph Slack
As an experienced software engineer and technology enthusiast, Joseph is interested in solving problems through technology. From blockchains, mobile, web and experiemental technology, finding new ways to apply technology to problems is his passion.

**Web development** is where it all began, building web pages, and eventually more complex solutions for a variety of purposes. Highly experienced in developing and deploying *back end* technologies and their associated build systems and frameworks including:
* PHP
* Ruby
* C/C++
* Java
* Python
* Go
* Javascript

And experience on the *front end* including:
* HTML/CSS/SASS
* Javascript
* React
* Angular 

In the **mobile development** space, Joseph began working with iOS and eventually Android. With an interest in performance and user experience, he began focusing on Objective-C native development, and eventually Swift (which is ongoing). With the advent of modern mobile compilation frameworks, he prefers to deploy to Android taking advantage of react-native bindings. The implication of mobile development is building user focussed products, and the direct consumer impact remains the key interest.

An early adopted of **bitcoin**, Joseph became obsessed with applying **blockchain** technology to other applications, along with thousands of early adopters online. What began as dicussions on forums and IRC channels, became a never ending research and development project, which continues to this day. Solving issues like inflation, banking fees, trustless transaction systems and smart contracts are extremely exciting projects that he continues to advocate and work on applying to real world problems. The future is exciting.

As an early adopter of technolgoy **Virtual Reality** was hard to ignore. As a hobbiest developer, creator of SDK tools, and advocate of the Unreal development suite, Joseph is interested in the boundaries of virtual life, and the implications of education, social impact, equality and the future of work. Although consumer products may take some time to be adopted, this remains an interesting field as the innevitable future unfolds in virtual reality space.
